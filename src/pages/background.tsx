        Somali people and contributed into the emergency humanitarian crisis and development of their country
        rehabilitation and reconstruction after years of destructive conflicts and successive droughts and famines
        which led to the total collapse of socio-economic and political institutions.
        The vulnerable communities in SoFDO targeted areas and Somalis in general live in extremely poor and
        under-developed conditions. Their livelihoods are broadly based on subsistence farming and pastoralism
        with limited opportunity to earn wages. The predominant livelihood systems are;1) Pastoralism a)Agro-
        pastoralist b) Agriculturalist: agriculture based livelihood. 2) Fishing: 3) Urban Residents and IDPs:
        Successive conflicts, droughts and famine had eroded the livelihoods coping mechanisms of these
        communities. The negative occurrences instigated a huge number of civilian population displaced internally
        and refugees’ camps in neighboring countries.

        developmental commitments in Somalia, by utilizing principally home-ground solutions to vulnerable
        community challenges and needs. SoFDO corresponds to the existing international and national
        humanitarian and development strategies.
