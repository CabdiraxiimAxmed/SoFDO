## Introduction:
SOFDA, the Somali Feeding Development Organisation, is a non-profit,
humanitarian organization committed to making a positive impact on Somalia's environment and communities.
In the past year, SOFDA has taken significant strides towards its mission of preventing climate change
in Somalia and beyond by initiating the "1-DA May School Tree Planting Campaign."
This campaign aims to combat the adverse effects of climate change, which have manifested in the form of heatwaves,
flooding, and long-term droughts, impacting the nation's ecosystems and vulnerable communities.

## Background:

Climate change is an imminent threat to Somalia's environmental stability and socio-economic development.
The nation has been experiencing extreme weather events with increasing frequency,
leading to severe consequences for its people and environment.
Recognizing the urgency of the situation, SOFDA launched its tree planting campaign as a proactive measure to
mitigate the effects of climate change.

## 1-DA May School Tree Planting Campaign:

The 1-DA May School Tree Planting Campaign, named after the school where the project began,
is a flagship initiative undertaken by SOFDA. The primary goal of this campaign is to restore and protect Somalia's ecological balance
through widespread tree plantation efforts. Trees play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,
thereby helping combat the escalating greenhouse effect responsible for global warming.

### Achievements:

Over the course of the past year, SOFDA has achieved significant milestones in the 1-DA May School Tree Planting Campaign:

1. **Tree Planting Initiatives:** With the dedicated efforts of our volunteers and generous support from donors and local communities, SOFDA successfully planted an impressive number of trees in various regions of Somalia. These trees include a diverse range of species, well-suited to the local environment.

2. **Environmental Awareness Programs:** SOFDA organized numerous awareness programs to educate communities about the importance of tree planting and its impact on climate change mitigation. These initiatives aimed to empower locals to actively participate in safeguarding their environment.

3. *Community Engagement:* Recognizing the need for community involvement in sustaining the initiative's success, SOFDA collaborated closely with local schools, religious institutions, and civic bodies. This engagement fostered a sense of ownership among communities, ensuring the longevity of the tree planting campaign.

4. **Research and Data Collection:** To enhance the effectiveness of our tree planting efforts, SOFDA worked in tandem with environmental researchers to study the most suitable tree species for each region. This research-based approach ensures that our tree planting activities yield maximum positive outcomes.

5. **Partnerships and Collaborations:** SOFDA forged partnerships with other like-minded organizations, both within Somalia and on the international stage, to amplify the impact of the tree planting campaign. These collaborations promote knowledge-sharing and resource pooling to address climate change more comprehensively.

## Impact and Future Prospects:

The impact of the 1-DA May School Tree Planting Campaign has been multi-fold:

1. **Carbon Sequestration:** By planting thousands of trees, SOFDA has contributed significantly to carbon sequestration, helping reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

2. **Ecosystem Restoration:** The tree planting campaign has initiated the process of ecosystem restoration in various regions, providing habitats for wildlife and promoting biodiversity.

3. *Climate Resilience:* The newly planted trees act as a natural buffer against extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, enhancing climate resilience for local communities.

4. **Livelihood Opportunities:** Tree planting initiatives have the potential to create sustainable livelihood opportunities, such as agroforestry and eco-tourism, benefiting vulnerable communities.

Looking ahead, SOFDO is determined to continue and expand the 1-DA May School Tree Planting Campaign.
Through innovative fundraising strategies, engaging partnerships, and continuous community involvement,
we strive to make a more substantial impact on climate change mitigation in Somalia and beyond.

## Conclusion:

The Somali Feeding Development Organisation's 1-DA May School Tree Planting Campaign has been a resounding success in the battle against climate change. By planting trees and raising awareness,
SOFDA has taken a commendable step towards ensuring a greener and more sustainable future for Somalia and the world. The organization remains steadfast in its commitment to combat climate change and is grateful for the unwavering support of its donors,
volunteers, and partners. Together, we shall continue nurturing the earth and building resilient communities for generations to come.
